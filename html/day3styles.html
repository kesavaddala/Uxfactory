    <p style="color: chocolate;">A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the
        topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of
        sentences that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
